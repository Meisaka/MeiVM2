Meisaka's "Wave Vector CPU"
Every user get's their own "thread"
All memory addresses hold a 16 bit word
i.e. 0x000 => 0xABCD, 0x001 => 0xEF39
All CPU registers are SIMD, and hold a vector of 4x 16bit words
A few special instructions, will treat registers as 8x 8bit words
CPU register words are loaded and stored in little endian order:
 i.e. the instruction pointer is at address 0x060
Bytes are also imported into words in little endian order.
each "thread" has:
8 Constant registers
7 General registers
The instruction register
64 Words of private access RAM

The instruction pointer is vector 0 from the instruction register
The address read will be truncated to 12 bits
All instruction opcodes are 16 bits, and use one address worth of memory

System memory map:
   0(0x000) ..=   31(0x01F) => System constant registers, accessible via load
  32(0x020) ..=   63(0x03F) => System mutable registers, accessible via load/store
  64(0x040) ..=  127(0x07F) => Thread private RAM
 128(0x080) ..= 2047(0x7FF) => For future use (read as zero for now)
2048(0x800) ..= 4095(0xFFF) => Shared RAM (other user threads can read/write)
Each memory location in shared RAM is rendered as a blocky pixel
The pixel format is rrrr rggg gggb bbbb => i.e. 0xf800 is pure RED
this mode is called RGB565

Register Index values:
 0..= 7 => constant registers 0 through 7 ("c0"..="c7") respectively
 8..=14 => general registers 0 through 6 ("r0"..="r6") respectively
 15 => instruction pointer register ("ri") word 0 ("x") is the instruction pointer
       words 1 to 3 ("y", "z", "w") are general-ish use (but useful as a mini-stack)

Instruction set:
 0..= 3 => System, Extra1,  Extra2,  Extra3,
 4..= 7 => Move,   Swizzle, Load,    Store,
 8..=11 => Math8,  Math16,  Shift8,  Shift16,
12..=15 => BitOp,  SpecOp,  Extra14, Extra15

dest source extra opcode
source and destination specify a register index, in the order described above.
Extra and the extra bits are for extended and future instructions,
if the instruction does not use the extra bits, they must be zero.

System executes special instructions based on extra bits:
0b0000=> Halt the thread
0b0001=> Sleep will suspend the thread for a certain number of ticks
 a sleep duration of zero acts like a no-op.
 the lower 3 bits of the destination field control the sleep duration:
 0b00 => source field used as a number of ticks (0 to 15)
 0b01 => lowest byte of source register as number of ticks
 0b10 => high byte of the lowest word of source register as number of ticks
 0b11 => lowest word of source register as number of ticks

Move copies source register words to destination register
 -> extra bits set to one will not copy the respective word (performs a "Mix" operation)
Swizzle re-arranges or copies the destination register words according to bits in "extra" and "source"
 -> given register [X,Y,Z,W] source: 0bWWZZ, extra: 0bYYXX
 -> every two bit index specifies which word to swizzle from.
Load and Store use the word(s) in the source register as an address
 -> the destination register will be loaded or written to memory
 -> "extra" bits used as modifiers:
 -> specifing number of words:
    0b00__=> 4, 0b01__=> 3, 0b10__=> 2, 0b11__=> 1
 -> 0b__0_ => sequential (low word from source as address)
 -> 0b__1_ => scatter/gather (each word in source used as address),
 -> 0b___0 => normal load/store
 -> 0b___1 => increment source address(es) after each load/store (updates source register)
Math# opcodes use source register as left hand and destination register as right
 -> extra bits used to select math operation:
 0b0000 => Add
 0b0001 => Add (Unsigned Saturate)
 0b0010 => Add (No carry: 0, carry: 1)
 0b0011 => Add (check sign: 0, -1)
 0b0100 => Sub (dst = src - dst)
 0b0101 => Sub (dst = src - dst) (Signed Saturate)
 0b0110 => Compare (src - dst) dst = (No carry: 0, carry: -1)
 0b0111 => Compare (equal: 0, not equal: -1)
 0b1000 => SubRev (dst = dst - src)
 0b1001 => SubRev (dst = dst - src) (Signed Saturate)
 0b1010 => CompareRev (dst - src) dst = (No carry: 0, carry: -1)
Shift# opcodes perform bitshifts on the destination register
 -> extra bits control shift:
 0b_000 => Left Shift,
 0b_001 => Right Shift (logical),
 0b_010 => Right Shift (sign extend)
 0b_011 => Left Rotate
 0b_100 => Left Shift (#-shift),
 0b_101 => Right Shift (#-shift) (logical),
 0b_110 => Right Shift (#-shift) (sign extend)
 0b_111 => Right Rotate
 0b0___ => Low (#8 => 3, #16 => 4) bits of source register words as shift amount
 0b1___ => source field as shift amount
BitOp performs a binary operation on source and destination
 -> extra bits form a truth table specifing the operation
 -> each bit from both registers forms index: source_bit + 2*destination_bit
 -> resulting operations:
 0b0000 => Zero, 0b1111 => One
 0b1000 =>  And, 0b1110 =>  Or, 0b0110 =>  Xor
 0b0111 => Nand, 0b0001 => Nor, 0b1001 => Xnor
 0b1010 => Src, Effectively a move without mask
 0b1100 => Dest, Effectively a no op
 0b0101 => NotSrc, 0b0011 => NotDest
 0b0010 => Src And NotDest (Dest Clears Src)
 0b0100 => NotSrc And Dest (Src Clears Dest)
 0b1011 => Src Or NotDest
 0b1101 => NotSrc Or Dest
SpecOp extra math operations
 -> extra bits used to select operation:
 0b0000 => Horizontal Add: dest.xyzw = src.x + src.y + src.z + src.w
 0b0001 => Dot product: Horizonal Add, but src is src * dst

the !vm commands to control your thread:
!vm help  (link to this info page)
!vm asm <program>  (tiny in-chat assembler: TODO)
!vm halt      (stop your thread)
!vm run       (default the instruction pointer and start your thread)
!vm restart   (defaults the instruction register, without directly affecting any other registers)
!vm clear     (resets all thread memory and registers to their defaults)
!vm dump      (prints the current state of the VM to the terminal, not very useful remotely)
!vm write <data>
!vm code <data>
<data> for !vm "write" and "code" consists of hex without any prefix
it's encoded from the most significant nibble first, to the least significant nibble last
i.e. the 0x123f 0x2014 values would be writen "123f2014"
all spaces or non-hex characters in input are ignored, except '!'
the presence of a ! in the input will end parsing of hex characters,
this will switch back to parsing sub-commands, a space is required after the '!'
i.e. "!vm halt write 1234! code 1234! restart run"
"!vm write" starts at address 000, and thus write to the constant registers first
"!vm code" starts at address 040, and thus write to the private RAM
The write commands can not write to shared memory, only running threads may do so.

default constant registers:
0=> [0, 0, 0, 0]
1=> [0, 0, 0, 0]
2=> [0, 0, 0, 0]
3=> [0, 0, 0, 0]
// all 1
4=> [1, 1, 1, 1],
// max pixel field values for R, G, B, A (todo)
5=> [31, 63, 31, 0],
// R shift, G shift, B shift, A (todo)
6=> [11, 5, 0, 0]
// start of shared RAM, start of program, future use: -1 for now
7=> [2048, 64, -1, -1]
standard registers default to all zero
instruction pointer will default to start of private RAM
